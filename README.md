css-lib
=======

This lib allowes you start a CSS document from wich you can fetch property values given a path.
The translation with of without inheritance of the values is up to you to decide.
This gives you the freedom to create your own rules.

The path you can construct is stack bases and therefore easily implemented in recursive functions.
For example traversing a DOM structure.

TODO:
 - default kit for processing html
 - split the property/values up into property/list/values
